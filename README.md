## Visualization-on-Honey-Distribution-Data
- In 2006, a global concern was raised over the rapid decline in the honeybee population, an integral component to American honey agriculture. Large numbers of hives were lost to “Colony-Collapse-Disorder”, a phenomenon of disappearing “worker-bees” causing the remaining “hive-colony” to collapse. Speculation around the cause of this disorder points to hive-diseases and pesticides harming the pollinators, though no overall consensus has been reached. Twelve years later, some industries are observing recovery but the American honey industry is still largely struggling. The U.S. used to locally produce over half the honey it consumes per year. Now, honey mostly comes from overseas, with 350 of the 400 million pounds of honey consumed every year originating from imports. This dataset provides insight into honey production supply and demand in America by state from 1998 to 2012.

- The Goal is to use Python visualization libraries such as seaborn and matplotlib to investigate the data and get some useful conclusions.
